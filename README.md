# Infinity-scroll Project
This Project demonstrates an infinite scroll functionality. 
The images are fetched from the Unsplash API. The moment all the images are loaded is tracked, in order to dinamicaly hide the loading animation. 
The project consists of a long collumn of images with margins on both left and right. The closer to the bottom, the scroll bar on the right will jump up when the next network request is made and more images are fetched. The project gives the impression of a seamless experience.
Additionally, by hovering on the image, we get the image description and by clicking on the image, the image can be seen on the unsplash website, to see the author or download the image.
The project is also Mobile Responsive.
